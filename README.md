I started in Java because I'm an idiot and it's too late to turn back now.

All of this code is cranked out as quickly as possible for those sweet leaderboard points. Don't judge me.

Tried to be a cool kid on day 2 and do the mod thing, but gave up and went with 2d aRrAyLiStS because I couldn't figure it out fast enough.

Lay eyes upon day 5 and weep at my suffering.
