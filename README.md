I started in Java because I'm an idiot and it's too late to turn back now.

Tried to be a cool kid on day 3 and do the mod thing, but gave up and went with 2d aRrAyLiStS because I couldn't figure it out fast enough.

All of this code is cranked out as quickly as possible for those sweet leaderboard points. Don't judge me.

Lay eyes upon day 5 and weep at my suffering.
